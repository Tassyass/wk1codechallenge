 ## Introduction
 In this repository, you will find three toy problems that will test your problem-solving skills and your ability to work with user input, perform calculations, and make decisions in JavaScript.

 ## Learning Goals
 By completing these challenges, you will:

Gain experience in working with user input.
Learn how to create functions that make decisions based on input.
Practice performing calculations and displaying results.


   ## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
Problem Statement: Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond to the correct grade, as shown below:

A: Marks greater than 79
B: Marks from 60 to 79
C: Marks from 50 to 59
D: Marks from 40 to 49
E: Marks less than 40

 ## Challenge 2: Speed Detector

Problem Statement: Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input, e.g., 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: "Points: 2".
If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: "License suspended".
